* Fundamentals of Web apps
** HTTP GET
The *Response* headers on top tell us for e.g. the size of the response in bytes
and the exact time of the response. An important header Content-Type tells us that
the response is a text file in utf-8 format and the contents of which have been formatted
with HTML. This way the browser knows the response to be a regular HTML page and
render it to the browser as is.
